            <h2> How to use the RPN calculator</h2>
        This is an RPN calculator; the operator buttons<br>
        execute operations. E.g., to multiply 2 and 3, press <br>
        '2 ENTER 3 x' and the result 6.00 will appear.<br>
        All results show two decimal places - cents - as this is<br>
        a financial calculator.<br>
        Pressing the 'P' button and then a function button such as<br>
        'PV' will display a list of values to enter in the order to<br>
        be entered. To use the function, click the numbers to enter<br>
        the first value, click 'Enter'; continue for each required<br>
        value except the last - click the function button required<br>
        once the last value has been entered into the window,<br> 
        and the results will appear.<br> 
        Tool tip text will display when the mouse pointer is held<br>
        over a non-numeric button.<br>
        You can enter as many values as you like by clicking 'ENTER'<br>
        after each one; this will push all these values on to the stack.<br>
        Each operator button click thereafter will operate on the <br>
        value in the window and the next value on the stack, i.e.<br>
        '2 ENTER 3 ENTER + x' will produce 16.00<br>
        The 'STO' buttons will store the value in the window in the<br>
        register number on the button; to recall the value click 'RCL'<br>
        followed by the numeric button that corresponds to the<br>
        register number.
